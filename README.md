# D3-challenge
In this challenge, I took data from the 2014 ACS website at https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml to create a scatter plot about 2 variables and their relation. I chose the poverty percentage and the percent that lacks healthcare for individual states.
